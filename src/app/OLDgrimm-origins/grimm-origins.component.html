              <p>The things I see aren’t for the faint of heart.</p>
              <p>And I am no longer willing to ignore them. Not even when my family, and my best friend, tell me to keep quiet about what’s happening. They say people will think I’m crazy.</p>
              <p>Maybe I am.</p>
              <p>But the spirit haunting my professor’s house is definitely trying to tell me something, and I’m the only one who can see it.</p>
              <p>The one person who can help me is my best friend's brother. But I don’t know if I can trust him or his friends. Or if I can step outside the protective bubble I’ve built around myself.</p>
              <p>At this point it’s a toss up: the ghosts will kill me or my panic attacks will.</p>
              <p>Either way, I figure I’m going to die.</p>
